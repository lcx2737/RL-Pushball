# RL-Pushball
Implement reinforcement learning algorithms in Pushball.
The algo is MADDPG from OpenAI at https://github.com/openai/maddpg.
The env is based on gym and MPE at https://github.com/openai/gym and https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs respectively.
I have already finished some of the task, some more works are expected.
